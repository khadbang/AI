# AI Bias Awareness Project

Project Overview
This project is dedicated to raising awareness about the inherent biases in Artificial Intelligence systems. Biases in AI can lead to discrimination and unfair outcomes, which may affect everything from job application screenings to loan approvals. Our aim is to highlight these biases through comprehensive documentation and collaborative solutions.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create widespread awareness about the various biases that can exist in AI technologies. By educating the public and professionals alike, we aspire to initiate a movement towards more ethical and equitable AI development practices.

 Introduction
Understanding AI Bias
AI systems learn from historical data, which can contain inherent biases. These biases can be perpetuated and amplified by AI, leading to skewed outcomes. Understanding the types of biases and their origins is the first step towards addressing them.

Why It Matters
Addressing AI biases is crucial for building trust in AI applications and ensuring they are used fairly across all sectors of society. The impact of biases can be profound, affecting lives and shaping future technologies.

List of AI Biases
This section will provide an overview of various biases, such as gender bias, racial bias, and more, each accompanied by real-world examples of their impact.

Mitigation Strategies
We will outline approaches such as diverse training datasets, algorithmic fairness techniques, and ongoing monitoring systems to mitigate biases in AI.

Educational Resources
A collection of accessible materials that explain AI biases in detail. These resources are intended to educate and empower users to recognize and advocate against AI biases.
